## Starter for NodeJS projects

This is a blank [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) (using [express](http://expressjs.com/)) project that will connect to any prismic.io repository, and trivially list its documents. It uses the prismic.io JavaScript development kit, and provides a few helpers to integrate with [express](http://expressjs.com/).

### Getting started

#### Launch the starter project

*(Assuming you've [installed Node.js and npm](http://www.joyent.com/blog/installing-node-and-npm/))*

Fork this repository, then clone your fork, and run this in your newly created directory:

```sh
npm install
node app
```

Your Node.js starter project is now up and running! However, by default, it will list and display documents from our "[Les Bonnes Choses](http://lesbonneschoses.prismic.me)" example repository.

#### Configure the starter project

Edit the `prismic-configuration.js` file to get the application connected to the right repository:

```
exports.Configuration = {

  apiEndpoint: 'https://lesbonneschoses.prismic.io/api',

  // -- Access token if the Master is not open
  // accessToken: 'xxxxxx',

  // OAuth
  // clientId: 'xxxxxx',
  // clientSecret: 'xxxxxx',
  ...
```

To set up the OAuth configuration and interactive signin, go to the _Applications_ panel in your repository's settings, and create a new OAuth application. You simply have to fill in an application name and potentially the callback URL (`localhost` URLs are always authorized, so at development time you can omit to fill in the Callback URL field). After submitting, copy/paste the `clientId` & `clientSecret` tokens into the proper place in your configuration.

You may have to restart your FRAMEWORK server.

#### Deploy your NodeJS application

An easy way to deploy your NodeJS application is to use [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com). Just follow these few simple steps once you have successfully [signed up](https://id.heroku.com/signup/www-header) and [installed the Heroku toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/):

Create a `Procfile` file at your application root, to declare the server command:

```
web: node app.js
```

Create a new Heroku application

```
$ heroku create
```

Push your code to heroku:

```
$ git push heroku master
```

Ensure you have at least one node running:

```
$ heroku ps:scale web=1
```

You can now browse your application online:

```
$ heroku open
```

#### Get started with prismic.io

You can find out [how to get started with prismic.io](https://developers.prismic.io/documentation/UjBaQsuvzdIHvE4D/getting-started) on our [prismic.io developer's portal](https://developers.prismic.io/).

#### Understand the JavaScript development kit

You'll find more information about how to use the development kit included in this starter project, by reading [its README file](https://github.com/prismicio/javascript-kit/blob/master/README.md).

### Contribute to the starter project

Contribution is open to all developer levels, read our "[Contribute to the official kits](https://developers.prismic.io/documentation/UszOeAEAANUlwFpp/contribute-to-the-official-kits)" documentation to learn more.
